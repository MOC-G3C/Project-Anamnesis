## What is ANAMNESIS?

ANAMNESIS is a physics-based memory system for game NPCs. Unlike traditional reputation systems (simple numbers going up and down), ANAMNESIS models relationships as **topological structures** that can form **permanent scars**.

### Key Concept: Topological Scars

When a traumatic event occurs (betrayal, violence, loss), the system doesn't just decrease a number - it creates a **permanent structural change** in the relationship network.

**Example:**
- Player kills an NPC's friend
- Traditional system: Reputation -50 (can be recovered with gifts)
- ANAMNESIS: **Irreversible scar** forms (relationship never fully recovers)

## Features

- ✅ **Trauma-Based Memory**: Events leave permanent marks
- ✅ **Asymmetric Relationships**: NPCs remember differently
- ✅ **Physics-Grounded**: Based on Landau phase transitions
- ✅ **Emergent Psychology**: Complex behaviors from simple rules
- ✅ **Game-Ready**: Designed for RPGs, strategy games, social sims

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MOC-G3C/Project-Anamnesis
cd Project-Anamnesis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Interactive Demo
```bash
streamlit run src/anamnesis_streamlit_simple.py
```

### Run Core Simulation
```bash
python src/anamnesis_core.py
```

## How It Works

ANAMNESIS models 4 agents in a 3D elastic space:

1. **Memory as Gravity**: Shared experiences pull agents together
2. **Trauma as Deformation**: Extreme stress permanently warps the space
3. **Entropy as Therapy**: Diverse connections prevent obsessive patterns

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Landau phase transitions (critical stress thresholds)
- Topological memory (hysteresis loops)
- Kuramoto oscillators (synchronization dynamics)

## Use Cases

### 🎮 **RPG Games**
Create NPCs who remember betrayals permanently. A king whose advisor you once exposed will **never** trust you with state secrets, even if you save his life later.

### ⚔️ **Strategy Games**
Allied AI that forms grudges. Betray an ally in turn 50? They'll remember and refuse critical trades in turn 500.

### 🏘️ **Social Simulations**
Characters with realistic trauma responses. An NPC who witnessed violence develops lasting anxiety around the player.
